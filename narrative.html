                There have been many challenges for not only the people that I have talked to online but the ones that I have talked to in person as well.
                One of the largest challenges that I have faced as well as others is Database. It is complex, now maybe it is just me still trying to learn it,
                but it is no easy feat and I applaud anyone that is able to do it from memory or even able to understand it. There are concepts that I am still trying to
                grasp but it is something that I want to work on while I am in school even if we don't have classes for it.
